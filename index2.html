        <h4>English</h4>
        <p>
          Our English program is a 12-week intensive course that reviews the
          structure of the test, all four skill areas (reading, listening,
          speaking, and writing), and useful techniques to help you achieve your
          desired score. We work on one skill area each day Mondays-Thursdays
          and finish the week with a practice exam that includes all four skill
          areas on Fridays.
